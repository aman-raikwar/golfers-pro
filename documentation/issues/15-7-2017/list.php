Completed:-

1. When adding a Golf club the button should say "Add Golf" and while editing the button should be "Save Changes".
2. When editing a golfer then "Date of Birth" field is showing 000000. This is happening with New Golfers registered now. For example check 16, 17 and even Priyanka Shikla entry that you did.
3. Terms and Conitions checkbox is also unchecked while editing a golfer.









when Platform admin logged and add golfer the card number should be populated according to golf clubs
yes but if we do not populate card numbers according to golf club then card of other golf club can be added to this selected golf club's golfer


We should not allow golfers to register with same First Name, Last Name and Phone Number even if their email address and username are differnt.


Select Country and County drodowns are opening at the top when click on them in Add Golfer page. Not able to add Golfer due to this issue.

Tried adding SAS00000001 (Top Range) and dsd00000000 (Bottom Range). And clicked on Add Cards it gave error All Cards already exists error. Instead it should give error that first three characters should be same.
Similarly i added only text 11 characters in both top range and bottom and then clicked on Add Card. The system allowed this also. Instead it should give Enter correct card format error>
Cards are not automatically assigned to a golfer when registering from self registration process. I tried this by registering a user in Baltimore club and this club already had cards assigned.

I was logged in a golf club in a browser and then in the same browser my mail was open through which i registered as another golf club. In that mail when i clicked on Login link it took me to the Dashboard page instead of login page. This should not happen.

All the tables in the website are missing the feature to copy the rows. Just like we have in the design.

All the tables should have the feature to export to CSV. This can be done by adding a value in datatable script. Please check this image: http://yogami.in/golfer/design/images/script.png

Color of First Name and Last name should be red just like in the deisgn: http://yogami.in/golfer/design/golfers.php
# should be replaced by ID in this table. Check design : http://yogami.in/golfer/design/golfers.php
